The report presents the value and volume forecasts of the MENA commercial vehicles (trucks) market and provides key insights into the factors driving the market growth as well as those restricting it. The estimates point to a revenue growth from nearly $5,250 million in 2017 to nearly $8,500 million by 2027 end, resulting in a CAGR of 5% during the period of assessment. In terms of volume, the MENA commercial vehicles (trucks) market was pegged at 1,52,191 units in 2017 and is poised to reach a figure of 2,12,232 units in 2027, and display a CAGR of 3.4% in the forecast period. Rapid development and growth of the oil and gas industry in the rest of the Middle-East region would boost market revenue growth. Commercial vehicles are commonly used as a medium of transport for different types of end-use industries and they are helping in tasks such as unloading, loading and transportation of goods. The construction industry is exhibiting a fast growth due to the vast number of projects in the pipeline in each country of the Middle East, and this also has connection with the plans of the countries in the Middle Eastern region to diversify their economies. These developments are also related to the large-scale international events that are going to be held in this region such as World Expo 2020 in Dubai and the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. The construction industry in Iran was estimated to be valued at $154.4 billion in 2016 against from $88 billion in 2013, and due to this upward growth, the market for heavy trucks is likely to boost in this country. Also, due to the rising urbanization, the construction industry is experiencing rapid growth in the rest of the countries in the Middle East, which is further expected to boost the demand for commercial vehicles in building and construction activities in the region. Iran is also one of the biggest markets for trucks in the MENA region, and with the economic sanctions lifted, it is experiencing a huge growth and is likely to be one of the prominent markets for heavy duty commercial vehicles. On the other hand, other countries in the region like the UAE and Oman are also becoming attractive markets for commercial vehicles due to their vast use in end-use industries such as petrochemicals, and this is expected to boost the overall demand for trucks in the Middle East region. The MENA commercial vehicles (trucks) market is segmented on the basis of class type and region. On the basis of class type, the market is segmented into light duty, medium duty and heavy duty. On regional basis, the market is segmented into Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Rest of Middle East) and North Africa.

        "blurb": "Busworld and UITP (the International Association of Public Transport) are proud to announce a strategic partnership that will see UITPs established International Bus Conference take place in conjunction with the renowned Busworld Europe exhibition in Kortrijk, Belgium. The world-class event, entitled UITP-Busworld International Bus Conference, combining Busworld and UITPs unrivalled major bus events, will be held in conjunction with Busworld Europe in Kortrijk (20-25 October 2017), the worlds oldest and most famous bus and coach exhibition. The two-day conference (23-24 October) will highlight the major trends and developments affecting the bus industry, from connected and autonomous buses to the rollout of clean electric bus fleets. The third day of the session will be devoted to exploring Research & Innovation in Europe and the rest of the world in buses and bus systems. The move is a logical partnership, combining UITPs global knowledge base with Busworlds more than 40 years experience and will see the two partners working closely together to develop the conference programme. The 2015 edition of Busworld Europe (Kortrijk) attracted some 34,932 visitors from 118 countries (up 9% on the previous edition) and more than 411 exhibitors. We are delighted to be partnering with Busworld. The partnership will offer visitors the complete picture of everything thats going on in this dynamic industry, when capacity is higher than ever thanks to double-articulated and Bus Rapid Transit and when buses are cleaner than ever thanks to hybrid and electric propulsion. We hope this move will enable the event to continue to grow in stature and become an even-more unmissable occasion on the industry calendar explained UITP Secretary General, Alain Flausch. Redgy Deschacht, President of Busworld Europe, strongly believes in this partnership. He explained: The world of bus and coach is changing so rapidly, that constantly updated information is crucial to the industry and its players. It is a responsibility that all the Busworld exhibitions fully want to take, by organising conference programmes in addition to the exhibitions. We are convinced of the added value that this partnership will bring for our visitors.",

        "blurb": "By R. Natarajan, Managing Editor & Publisher In the field of auto components, Talbros is the most sought-after brand for years. The group specialises in a wide range of auto components which are well accepted both in the OE and aftermarket segments. With a group turnover of Rs. 2,200 crores, Talbros always believes in delivering durable, quality products. QH Talbros Ltd., manufacturing steering linkages, is one of the flagship organisations within the group. Though there are several strong rivals in the field, QH Talbros has proved the overall market leader in the country with highest market share in steering linkages. In the commercial vehicle segment alone, it has become the No.1 player and its products have proved the preferred choice of all the leading OEMs like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Daimler, Volvo Eicher, Mahindra Truck & Bus, MAN, SML ISUZU, etc. In an exclusive interview to MOTORINDIA, Mr. M. Malhotra, Associate Vice President  Sales & Marketing, QH Talbros Pvt. Ltd. said the company has ambitious plans for the aftermarket segment which is growing faster year after year. Despite several challenges being faced by the Indian economy following last years demonetization and the GST roll-out, QH Talbros put up an excellent performance during 2017-18 by achieving a record turnover of Rs. 521 crores. Currently, out of the total revenue, 62% comes through OE business activities. He said that, in order to maintain the growing business trend of its aftermarket activities, the company recently came out with new products such as horns, wipers and rubber bushing kits with disruptive packages backed with the Make in India slogan. For instance, the wiper package is being made by incorporating eight languages, including the regional languages of Tamil, Telugu, etc., and is being sold under the brand name of Talbros RAINVANTAGE. While the horns are marketed under the brand name of X-sound, the rubber bushing kit products are sold under the brand name of Mr. BUSHING. Of significance to note here is that all the new packages have a very fancy design and colour for customer attraction, and they are delivered to customers in line with the FMCG products known for their quality standard. Mr. Malhotra further disclosed that though many companies have opted for parts by sourcing from China, QH Talbros has taken the right means by getting the products from the local manufacturers as part of the companys philosophy to encourage Make in India initiative. However, the company strictly monitors the quality of products delivered by the supplier before marketing. Q for Quality and H for Honesty For QH Talbros, Quality and Honesty are the buzzwords. This has been substantially proved by the companys maintaining the high level Total Quality Management System. All its six manufacturing plants maintain a systematic approach by producing quality products sold at affordable prices. The company has been receiving the Best Supplier Awards, including for TPM and TQM, from most of the OEMs. This is testimony to its commitment to product quality. For instance, the Manesar plant has been recognised as the most modern one for TPM activities by the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM), he added. Mr. Malhotra joined QH Talbros a decade ago after serving reputed organisations like Kirloskar Oil Engines and Federal Mogul. He is really optimistic about the future prospects of the Indian auto component industry and feels that the next few years will be best for Indian automotive and auto component industry.",

        "blurb": "Through both acquisitions and organic growth, the Volvo Group has attained a good position from which to develop further in the dynamic markets in Asia which accounted for 23 per cent of its net sales during 2012. In 2000 it was just seven per cent. The sharp increase has primarily been achieved by the acquisitions of UD Trucks of Japan (named Nissan Diesel at the time of the acquisition), the majority in Lingong of China and through the joint venture VECV in India, as also through organic growth. We examine the heavyweights bid to become the global numero uno in the heavy-duty truck segment. At the beginning of 2013, the Volvo Group signed an agreement to purchase 45 per cent of the Chinese truck manufacturer Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles (DFCV), which will give it a strong presence on the Chinese truck market  the worlds largest. On completion of the transaction, the Volvo Group will become the worlds largest manufacturer of heavy duty trucks. This is a very exciting venture that will combine the best of two worlds: strengthening the positions of the Volvo Group and Dongfeng and offering excellent opportunities to both parties, says Volvos President and CEO Olof Persson. Combining Dongfengs strong domestic position and know-how with the Volvo Groups technological expertise and global presence will offer DFCV an excellent opportunity for growth and profitability in and outside China. Completion within a year Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the relevant anti-trust agencies and Chinese authorities. The purchase consideration amounts to RMB 5.6 billion. The objective is to complete the transaction as soon as possible, within about 12 months. Payment of the purchase price will increase Volvos net debt by approximately SEK 6 billion. The Volvo Group is the worlds third largest manufacturer of heavy duty trucks with 180,000 units sold in 2011. Dongfeng was the second largest producer of heavy duty trucks in 2011, with total sales of 186,000 units, of which approximately 142,000 units were produced by that part of the company which will be included in DFCV. We are pursuing a clear strategy to achieve our vision of becoming the world leader in sustainable transport solutions, says Olof Persson. With this agreement in place, we take a crucial step toward reaching a number of our key strategic objectives such as size and growth in Asia. Worlds largest truck market During 2012, the Chinese market for heavy duty trucks totalled approximately 636,000 vehicles, while the corresponding figure for the medium duty market was 290,000 vehicles. DFCV occupied a leading position in China in both the heavy and medium-duty segments, with sales of 102,000 heavy duty trucks and 45,500 medium duty trucks, corresponding to market shares of 16.1 per cent and 15.7 per cent respectively. The partnership with DFG not only provides the Volvo Group with ownership in the largest heavy duty and medium duty truck manufacturer in China, but also offers excellent opportunities to achieve economies of scale in terms of sourcing, development and production for the groups truck operations. There are a number of areas in which co-operation is planned between DFCV and the Volvo Group, such as engines and powertrain components, product platforms and purchasing. In Dongfeng, we have a partner that we know well, having worked together for several years, and with a management team and a product range that we really appreciate, says Olof Persson. Joining forces will provide clear benefits for both parties and the right conditions to develop DFCV into a competitive and successful international truck manufacturer with healthy profitability. Investments in India During the year, VECV, the joint venture with Eicher Motors, strengthened its position in the Indian market. The total market for trucks and buses above 5 tons decreased by 12 per cent, but VECVs deliveries remained at the same level as the previous year and the market share rose to 12.7 per cent (11.1), the highest so far. Within buses Eichers share rose to 11.9 per cent (9.7), for trucks of 5-14 tons to 31.4 per cent (30.5) and in the heavy duty segment over 16 tons to 3.9 per cent (3.1). VECV continues to invest in India. During 2012 and the next few years, some SEK 2 billion is invested in a new factory for medium-duty engines that will be up and running in 2013, a new paint shop, tooling for new products and a new facility for bus chassis. The investment also covers research and development related to a number of new products to be launched in the next few years. The investments are made with funds already with VECV and with the companys future cashflow. Furthermore, Volvo India invests approximately SEK 2.5 billion in the next few years, among other things, in a new factory in Bangalore for production of the new truck series planned for the value segment. In addition, investments are made in the development of new products and in a new office in Bangalore where backoffice functions that were previously spread out over the city are to be gathered. Volvo Buses strong in India Volvo Buses has a strong position in India and is one of the most well-known brands on the market. In total, 4,500 buses from Volvo are in operation in the country. Volvos city buses run in 13 cities, and in the coaches segment, the company is represented on all important routes. During the year a number of new models were launched, among them the long-distance coach Volvo 9100 which opens up new market segments and increases the potential for growth. In Japan the total market for heavy duty trucks in 2012 rose by 28 per cent to 31,800 vehicles (24,800) partly driven by government incentives as well as the need for trucks for reconstruction work following the earthquake and the tsunami. For 2013, the total Japanese market is expected to increase to about 35,000 heavy duty trucks on the back of expectations of higher economic activity following the government offer of stimulus and a weaker currency. In India, the total 2012 market for heavy duty trucks declined by 18 per cent to 195,140 trucks (237,300). In China the largest part of net sales stem from construction equipment. The Chinese construction equipment market continued to weaken in 2012 and declined by 37 per cent (+7 per cent). In Asia, outside of China, the market for construction equipment grew by 11 per cent (28). For 2013 the total market growth in China is expected to be in the range of minus 5 per cent to plus 5 per cent. Asia, excluding China is expected to decline by 0 per cent to 10 per cent. Volvo CE number 1 in China With a volume totaling 248,000 wheel loaders and excavators in 2012, the Chinese market is by far the worlds largest, and the Volvo Group is the No.1 in these segments. During 2012 Volvo CE with the brands Volvo and SDLG had a combined market share of 15.0% (12.0) within wheel loaders and excavators. That increased the distance even further to the number two on the market. Part of Volvo CEs strategy is to develop products for growth markets under the Volvo brand. In November 2012, the medium heavy wheel loader Volvo L105 was launched. It was developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in China. Since 1998, Volvo CEs main facility for development and manufacture of excavators is situated in Changwon, South Korea. Sunwin, leading within large electric buses China is a large market for electric buses. Currently there are 1,700 large (over 10 metres) electric buses in China, an increase of 1,000 buses during 2012 alone. Here Sunwin Bus, a Volvo Buses and SAIC Motor joint venture, has a market share of approximately 40 per cent. During the year, Sunwin Bus delivered 3,250 units, 512 of which were the so-called new energy buses and 413 fully electric. That made Sunwin leading in China and a world-leading supplier of large, fully electric buses in 2012. In the next few years, the Volvo Group plans to launch a new series of trucks in the so-called value segment, i.e., the lower price segment, in emerging markets of Asia, South America and Africa. Production is underway in Thailand and India. The group also intends to manufacture these trucks for the Chinese market in the joint venture DND.",

        "blurb": "The jubilee year (125 years) of the automobile was another successful year for Daimler. But we believe we can do even better. says Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management, Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. We see why and how the year gone-by was a big success for Daimler, as we zero in on the performance of Daimler Trucks and Daimler Buses in 2011. The year 2011 was a very good one for Daimler Trucks. Total unit sales increased by 20 per cent to 425,800 vehicles worldwide, while revenue grew by 20 per cent to Euro 28.8 billion and EBIT rose by a strong 41 per cent to Euro 1.9 billion. We are updating our product range very successfully in all business units and regions. The best example is the new Mercedes-Benz Actros, which was already named Truck of the Year in its year of launch. After the natural disaster in Japan, Fuso quickly returned to its previous level of production, thanks to its employees exceptional efforts. And we are boosting efficiency worldwide by intensifying global co-operation between procurement, production and production planning, adds Dr. Zetsche. Excellent sales in Europe, Latin America Trucks Europe/Latin America has global responsibility for all the truck activities of the Daimler Group under the Mercedes-Benz brand. With another strong increase in unit sales to 159,300 vehicles (2010: 135,200), Trucks Europe / Latin America equalled the high level of 2007. A significant contribution came from Western Europe, where Daimler remained the market leader in the medium- and heavy-duty truck segments. In Russia, its unit sales doubled to 3,300 vehicles, thanks to co-ordinated activities with Kamaz. In Latin America, the companys unit sales reached a new record of 52,600 vehicles. Despite the tough competition in Brazil, the regions biggest market, Daimler achieved the high level of the prior year with sales of 44,100 units. The current Euro III emissions regulations will be replaced by the more stringent Euro V standards in Brazil in 2012 and in Argentina in 2013. In response to these developments, truck manufacturers are upgrading their model ranges. With Daimlers product line-up, it is well prepared for the change. Trucks Asia expansion With its Canter, Fighter and Super Great truck models, the Fuso brand has gained a reputation around the world as a quality-focused truck manufacturer whose products range from light-duty models to heavy-duty vehicles. Fuso is also Daimler Trucks Center of Excellence for light-duty trucks and cutting-edge hybrid technology. Despite challenges, Fuso managed to sell 147,700 vehicles in 2011, which was actually five per cent more than in the prior year. The Japanese market accounted for 27,000 units, representing an increase of nine per cent. In Eastern Europe, sales rose by 28 per cent. Another milestone was registered in Russia where 2,000 vehicles were sold in 2011 (2010: 800). Trucks Asias unit sales rose significantly also in the NAFTA region, up by a strong 16 per cent to 3,500 vehicles. In another important development, it launched medium-duty Fuso trucks in South Africa in early October. In RIC countries Daimler Trucks is also enjoying success in the RIC countries. In Russia, for example, Fuso Kamaz Trucks Rus has been manufacturing Canter vehicles since 2010. The official inauguration of the new Mercedes-Benz Trucks Vostok production line, which manufactures Actros, Axor and Unimog models, followed in early 2011. The truck plant in Chennai has been completed, and it has begun producing vehicles of the new BharatBenz brand. A major success for Daimler in China last year was its receiving the final approval to establish a joint venture with Foton Motor. With its 50 per cent stake in Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co., Ltd., it will further strengthen and expand its position in medium- and heavy-duty trucks segment in the Chinese market. Market outlook Worldwide demand for medium and heavy trucks in 2012 is expected to be at least at the level of last year. Despite a perceptible slowdown, the North American market should prove to be the worlds most important driver of demand, expanding by 15-20 per cent. Above all, in the US, the sustained growth in investment and the increasing need for replacements due to the relatively old fleet of vehicles should allow strong growth in demand once again. However, demand for trucks in Europe will be impacted by the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis and the resulting economic weakness. So, at best, demand in that market can only be expected to be as strong as last year. Market contraction of up to 10 per cent is not impossible from todays perspective, but Daimler foresees a better development in the second half of the year than in the first. The Japanese market for heavy- and medium-duty trucks should expand once again by 5 to 10% compared with the prior year, thanks to the countrys economic growth, which is benefiting from the reconstruction efforts. Overall demand for trucks in the emerging markets should grow only moderately this year. In China, new registrations are expected to normalize, after they had already fallen last year with the withdrawal of State incentives for truck buyers. Demand in India is likely to stabilize. The Brazilian market, which is important to Daimler, will probably experience a drop in demand of 10-15 per cent following introduction of more stringent emission regulations (similar to Euro V). In Russia, growth rates should be significantly more moderate than in the past two years. Buses Division The Daimler Buses Division with its brands Mercedes-Benz, Setra and Orion, continues to be the worlds leading manufacturer with a large margin in its core markets in the segment of buses and coaches above 8 tons. The product range supplied by Daimler Buses covers city and inter-city buses, coaches and bus chassis. The most important of the 15 production sites are in Germany, France, Spain, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the US. Daimler Buses clearly maintained the leading position in all its key markets, despite weaker market demand for complete buses. The company further increased its unit sales in 2011, defending its leadership in its core markets in the segment of buses over 8 tons. With the presentation of the new Mercedes-Benz Citaro, it is setting new benchmarks in the premium city-bus segment. In 2011, 43 per cent of Daimler Buses revenue was generated in Western Europe, 11 per cent in the NAFTA markets and 29 per cent in Latin America (excluding Mexico). While the company mainly sells complete buses in Europe and the NAFTA region, its business in Latin America, Africa and Asia is focused on production and distribution of bus chassis. With unit sales of 39,700 complete buses and bus chassis, the company surpassed the prior-year figure by two per cent despite a generally difficult market situation. In its core markets in the segment of buses over 8 tons gross vehicle weight, it was the market leader by a large margin once again in 2011. The factors contributing for the increase in unit sales were the positive business development for Mercedes-Benz bus chassis in Latin America, including Mexico, and significant growth in sales of complete buses in Turkey. In Western Europe, unit sales decreased by 17 per cent to 5,900 buses. Nonetheless, Daimler Buses succeeded in maintaining its leading position in the region with a market share of 27 per cent (2010: 29.6 per cent). In Latin America, Daimler Buses increased its chassis sales of the Mercedes-Benz brand by 8 per cent to 25,000 units. Its market share in Latin America therefore remained at a high level of 43 per cent (2010: 47.1 per cent). While the Mexican market continued to recover, unit sales decreased in North America. City bus launched in India In March 2012, Daimler Buses launched the first Mercedes-Benz city bus in the Indian market. Following the launch of a two-axle coach in 2008 and a three-axle coach in 2010, the company now aims to establish itself in the countrys city-bus market with its Mercedes-Benz brand. The Indian market already has a high volume of about 50,000 buses per annum and is expected to grow rapidly in the years ahead. India already has the worlds largest bus market after China.",

        "blurb": "Exports fare even better with 24% jump The turnover of the Indian automotive component industry that contributes 2.3 per cent to Indias GDP and has a share of 4 per cent in Indias exports stood at Rs. 3.45 lakh crores ($51.2 billion) for the period April 2017 to March 2018, registering a growth of 18.3 per cent over the previous year. This is as per the figures released by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) in its Industry Performance Review for fiscal 2017-2018. The above data represents the supply from the auto component industry (ACMA members and non-members), on-road and off-road vehicle manufacturers and the aftermarket in India along with exports. The data also includes component supplies captive to the OEMs. Commenting on the performance of the auto component industry in India, Mr. Vinnie Mehta, Director General, ACMA, said: The year gone by witnessed an upswing in the overall performance of the vehicle industry, despite it facing several regulatory challenges. The component industry, in tandem, posted an encouraging performance with significant growth of 18.3 per cent over the previous fiscal, registering a turnover of Rs. 3,45,635 crores ($51.2 billion). Further exports grew by 23.9 per cent in FY 2017-18 to Rs. 90,571 crores ($13.5 billion). Speaking about the need for Government intervention to sustain long-term growth in the auto component industry, Mr. Nirmal Minda, ACMA President, said: The dynamics of the automotive market is undergoing a significant transformation as the industry strives to become compliant to various regulations related to emissions, safety and environment, including the transition from BS-IV to BS-VI. That apart, key trends such as vehicle connectivity, electrification of vehicles, shared mobility and Industry 4.0, among others, are also redefining mobility. To support the changing customer needs and to stay relevant, the auto component sector needs to be encouraged with supportive Government policies. He added: One of the key demands of the industry has been a uniform 18% GST rate across the auto component sector; currently 60 per cent of the auto components attract 18 per cent GST rate, while the rest 40 per cent, majority of which are two-wheelers and tractor components, attract 28 per cent. The latter high rate has led to flourishing grey operations in the aftermarket. A benign rate of 18 per cent will not only ensure better compliance, but will also ensure a larger tax base. Further, considering the significant technological changes that the industry is undergoing, there is a critical need for creating a fund to support indigenous R&D and technology creation in the component industry as also for technology acquisition from other parts of the world. Lastly, as we prepare for the introduction of electric mobility in the country, a well defined, technology agnostic road-map with clear responsibilities of each stakeholder will go a long way in ensuring a smooth roll out as also leading to creation of a local supply base for the same. Key findings of the ACMA review Exports of auto components grew by 23.9 per cent to Rs. 90,571 crores ($13.5 billion) from Rs. 73,128 crores ($10.9 billion) in 2016-17. Europe accounted for 34 per cent of exports, followed by North America and Asia, with 28 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. The key export items included drive transmission & steering, engine components, body/chasis, suspension & braking, etc. Imports of auto components increased by 17.8 per cent to Rs. 1,06,672 crores ($15.9 billion) in 2017-2018 from Rs. 90,571 crores ($13.5 billion) in 2016-2017. Asia accounted for 60 per cent of imports followed by Europe and North America, with 30 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. With the expanding vehicle base in the country, the aftermarket in 2017-18 grew by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 61,601 crores ($9.2 billion) from Rs. 56,096 crores ($8.4 billion) in the previous fiscal. Turnover data represents the entire supplies from the auto component industry (ACMA members and non-members) to the on-road and off-road vehicle manufacturers and the aftermarket in India as well as exports. This also includes component supplies captive to the OEMs and by the unorganized and smaller players.",

The programme provides an understanding of the modern automobile technology, scientific way of repair and maintenance, overhaul of commercial vehicles and customer service management to students. This aspect is critical in the present-day market, particularly with the advent of new generation commercial vehicles and manufacturing techniques. VECV has signed an MoU with the Ramakrishna Mission Vidhyalaya, Coimbatore, as a part of its unique initiative in December 2012. The company has so far established seven centres with state-of-the-art automobile labs at prominent institutes in the country. The first centre was set up at ITI Kubernagar (Ahmedabad) in collaboration with the Gujarat Government and the second at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore. The third and the fourth were established at the Rayat Bahra Education Group, Mohali, and the MCKV Institute of Engineering, Howrah. The fifth and sixth centres were founded at Dehradun and Vijayawada. The Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya  Eicher Centre for Automobile Technology (RMVITI), the seventh such centre, was inaugurated recently at the institutes premises in Coimbatore by Mr. Vikram Mohan, Managing Director, Pricol Ltd., who was the chief guest on the occasion, in the presence of Mr. Vinod Aggarwal, CEO, VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd. Addressing the students, Mr. Vikram said: Over the past few years industry bodies like CII, ACMA and SIAM have been actively talking about increasing the industry-institution linkages. Since youngsters are the future of the nation, you need to take it to the next level with your efforts and hard work. As you embark on this journey in creating a career, you need to set SMART goals which are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and have a time-frame. In his special address, Mr. Aggarwal said: With signs of recovery seen in the commercial vehicle industry, we notice that there is going to be a huge shortage of skilled manpower in the coming years, and this is the reason why we started collaborating with educational institutions. This is our seventh training centre, with four more coming up soon. We have already started to recruit students for our company and our dealerships from these centres. It is a win-win situation for us. Earlier, Mr. A. Nandakumar, GM-Aftermarket, VECV, Pithampur, highlighted the human resource requirement in the automobile industry and the skill gap that exists. In his presentation, he said: With the increase in use of electronics, complicated engine design and hybrid technology in vehicles, skilled manpower has become a key factor. The quality of personnel coming out of these institutions does not match the current needs of the industry. There is an additional need of 25 million people in this sector, of which 65 per cent ITI graduates. We at VECV have also developed a special curriculum to address this skill gap. This ETTP program is specially designed to cover the latest in the automotive industry and provide exposure to modern manufacturing processes and supply chain management as well as to workshop operation processes. These students will be given on-the-job training program at our dealerships. Our joint venture with institutes is unique. We supply training aids with which one can teach from basics to overhauling of automobiles. We also provide vehicles for driving practice and station one of our engineers who would ensure proper training/teaching for candidates, he added. Swami Abhiramananda, Secretary, RMV, Mr. Murali and Mr. Balasubramaniam, Principals, RMV, also conveyed their special thanks to VECV for its excellent initiative towards betterment of the society. Ramakrishna Mission Vidhyalaya in Coimbatore, affiliated to the Ramakrishna Mission, Belurmath, Howrah, is among the oldest institutes in the country and was founded in 1930 with the blessings of Sri Ramakrishna. The foundation for the institute was laid by the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. It offers both vocational training, and diploma courses and has 14 educational wings catering to the varied education requirements of the students. The courses offered include the latest automobile technology covering modern manufacturing techniques, supply chain management and customer service management. This helps students to be industry-ready on completion of the course and get absorbed in organizations with minimum orientation and training. The automobile lab of the institute is equipped with VECVs modern training aids like dynamic cutaways, practice units, multi-media training aids and technical publications, both comprehensive and pictorial, teaching the students the latest in automotive technology, scientific way of repair maintenance and overhauling of commercial vehicles.",

        "blurb": "Bharat Forge Ltd. (BFL) has registered an improved performance in the quarter across all parameters despite sales remaining flat compared to the previous quarter. This has been achieved on the back of various productivity improvement and cost containment measures taken by the company over the past few months to realign cost with the lower demand level. For the year as a whole, the strong performance in the first half of the fiscal was neutralized by the across-the-board weak global demand environment towards the end. Even now the demand environment is uncertain with intermittent bouts of volatility, although there are signs of the bottom being reached for various markets. The industrial sector is still showing extreme weakness across Construction & Mining and Oil & Gas space, for which BFL supplies value-added products. There is lack of clarity about the pace of demand recovery in various markets. With the companys lean cost base and dynamic business model, it is well placed to capture demand growth once the environment improves. At this point BFL expects demand in the first quarter to be stable to slightly positive as compared to the previous quarter, but still lower year over the year. The companys shipment tonnage marginally declined by one per cent on a sequential and declined by 35.2 per cent on a Y-o-Y basis on the back of a decline in demand across major sectors & geographies. Revenues were flat in Q4 FY13 at Rs. 6,746 million as compared to Q3 FY13. Review of Indian market FY13 has been one of the most challenging years the automotive industry has witnessed in a decade. The industry simultaneously faced several headwinds like high interest rates & inflation, high fuel prices, low or lack of capital investments, weak consumer sentiment, and GDP growth dropping to a decade low. This had an adverse effect on the industry with only the utility vehicle segment registering growth during the year on the back of new product launches. BFLs main market, the M&HCV segment, witnessed a steep decline of 27.6 per cent for the year as a whole while it declined by 40.4 per cent in Q4 FY13 compared to Q4 FY12. BFL sales to the automotive sector (commercial & passenger vehicles, including utility vehicles) declined by 16 per cent in FY13 on a Y-o-Y basis. However, with its strong, sound manufacturing and technological prowess and customer relationships, it won new business in FY13 from both the CV and utility vehicle segments. Slowdown in industrial activity and lack of capital investment had their impact on demand for components for the industrial sector across segments. The diesel generator segment registered moderate growth due to high power deficit and shortage of coal for power plants. BFL caters to the industrial sector across Railways, power (renewable & non-renewable), Government agencies and the capital goods segment in the domestic market. During the year, orders from the sectors dried up and revenues from the industrial segment declined by 23 per cent to Rs. 510 crores. Export markets FY13 has been a tumultuous year for BFLs major markets. Strong growth in the first half of the year was followed by an equally weak environment in the second half. The demand decline in the latter part of FY13 and the havoc witnessed in FY 2008-09 during the global meltdown were identical in the aspect that the decline was sudden & concurrent across markets, customers & segments. The commercial vehicle industry witnessed declines ranging from around 10 per cent to as much as 40 per cent in the EU, India and China. The performance of the passenger vehicle segment in CY12 was similar to that of the CV segment. Based on the market data for the past two-three months, the demand environment seems to have bottomed out and there are initial green shoots of demand recovery from certain pockets as evident from uptick in order intake of European OEMs. It is however difficult to go the full distance and definitely claim that the demand will continue in a northwardly direction. The industrial sector is still showing extreme weakness across construction & mining and oil & gas space, for which BFL supplies value-added products. The performance of industrial business from the export markets was similar to the automotive segment. Drop in demand in the 2nd half of the year coupled with production cut at OEM end has resulted in destocking of inventory which continues even now. New orders won BFL has won new domestic and export orders across auto & industrial sector. Significant progress has been made on enhancing exposure to the passenger vehicle segment across major geographies. New orders in the industrial segment are across the oil & gas, construction and the Railways. The new orders have enabled BFL to add new marquee OEM names and increase the market share with the existing customers. It indeed reflects BFLs strong focus on innovation and its full service supply capability enabling it to provide technologically advanced components to customers globally. A majority of the new orders are expected to go into serial production towards the end of FY14.",

        "blurb": "In business and industry managers often need to predict the behavior of an important parameter that plays a vital role on the health of the business. These could include, among others, concerns such as,\nIdentifying whether a particular loan applicant is likely to defaultUnderstanding the product purchase preference of individual customersIdentifying the customers who are likely to leave the organisations servicesPredicting the likely purchase spend for customers with given demographic profiles\nPredictive models are built by observing the past behavior of the parameter of interest as well as the effect of those factors that affect its behavior, and then building a mathematical relationship between them. For example, in order to predict loan default, relevant historical on all the past defaulters would be studied in order to establish a mathematical relationship between defaulting behavior and other characteristics of the defaulters. This relationship is termed a Predictive Model.\n\nThe name Predictive Model derives from the fact that given a mathematical relationship, and the values of the affecting parameters  often termed thepredictors it is possible to predict the value of the parameter of interest, which is itself called the dependent variable.\nIn simpler scenarios, a Predictive Model may be represented generically as,\ny =f(x1, x2, x3, x4. xn)\n\nWhereyis the dependent variable, i.e. the parameter whose outcome we are interested in predicting, andx1, x2, x3, x4. xnare the independent predictors, which affect the behavior ofy.\nNote that, in more complex cases the model may become more challenging, with the outcome ofybecoming dependent not one, but on a system of equations.\nBuilding Predictive Models\nPredictive Models can be built using a variety of techniques, including\nMultiple RegressionLogistic RegressionNeural NetworksDecision TreesCluster Analysis\nThe choice of technique generally depends on the nature of the problem as well as the characteristics of the variable to be used in the analysis.\nThese techniques are available in Predictive Analytics software such as SPSS and R.\nScoring\nScoring is the method of substituting the value of the independent predictors in the mathematical relationship obtained by the modeling process, in order to obtain the prediction for the parameter of interest. In the above example, newly observed values of the predictor variablesAge, Gender, Income, Marital Status and Professionmay be applied to the mathematical relationship, in order to obtain a predicted value for the parameter Defaulter .\nCurrently scoring may be done in about three ways\nManually input the values and calculate on pen and paperBuild the relationship as a spreadsheet formula, and the input the valuesRun scoring in a batch mode in the software where the model was built in the first place, if this feature is supported\nIn the first two cases where there are significant challenges of computation and understanding of the theory behind the model, in the last case the scoring gets restricted to only those who have access to modeling software.\nThe Challenge of Usability\nThe modely =f(x1, x2, x3, x4. xn)is very powerful. For by predicting likely outcomes, it allows decision makers at all levels to decide their future course of action more objectively. However, given the skill levels required to actually use it, its use is not in the easy reach of those who can benefit the most, but yet do not have the necessary skills to understand complex mathematical models. This is depicted in figure 1, which also shows that in comparison, the humble calculator, though not a very powerful tool, is nonetheless very easy to use.\n\nDeployment\nIn figure 1 above, can we shift the model to the right , so that while retaining its power , it becomes as easy to use as the calculator ? This is the challenge that deployment addresses.\nIn other words, deployment is the process of presenting a Predictive Model to the untrained end-user, so that while he or she can take full advantage of its power to predict outcomes, without an associated learning curve.\nThese are end users who need to predict, but\nDo not have any background or understanding of the mathematical principles of Predictive ModelsDo not have access to expensive analytical softwareMaybe geographically distributedMay need frequent changes or updates to models as business parameters and priorities change\nThis can be achieved by translating the model via an application into an online form, somewhat like in figure 2, where the user inputs the values of the independent variables and the application returns the predicted outcome at the click of a button.\nFigure 2. Online Prediction Form\nOnce we are able to derive this form from the Predictive Model, it in turn could be delivered to geographically dispersed users either via browsers (figure 3) or Smartphones (figure 4)\nFigure 3. Online Prediction on a Browser\n\nFigure 4. Prediction on Smartphone\nOnce this is achieved we have an effective system for deployment that makes it possible for the untrained end-user to harness the power of Predictive Models as easily as a calculator, as shown in figure 5.\nDeployment represents the last stage in the analytics process. With this in place, and the power of Predictive Modeling available to all users in the organization, Predictive Modeling can now be operationalised. It can be used in day to day operational decision making rather than being restricted in its use in an organizational niche for strategic purposes only,\nDeployment with Analuo\nFigure 6 : Deployment with Analuo\nAnaluo is a deployment portal for analytics, intended to enable organizations in operationalising their Predictive Analytics initiative. With its patent pending technology for online prediction, addresses this challenge of deployment. As depicted in figure 6, an analyst uses data in SPSS or R to build a Predictive Model. This Model is now exported out as a PMML file. PMML, standing for Predictive Model Markup Language is an open standard defined by the Data Mining Group (www.dmg.org) for defining and sharing Predictive Models.\nThe Predictive Model, in PMML format, is uploaded to Analuo, which dynamically creates a interface, in the shape of a Prediction Form based on the model, which can is delivered either via a browser or on a Smartphone using Analuos Android app. An end-user, even though not skilled in the techniques of Predictive Modeling, now has to simply enter the values of the independent variables or predictors in the form to obtain a prediction.",

This is the challenge that deployment addresses.\nIn other words, deployment is the process of presenting a Predictive Model to the untrained end-user, so that while he or she can take full advantage of its power to predict outcomes, without an associated learning curve.\nThese are end users who need to predict, but\nDo not have any background or understanding of the mathematical principles of Predictive ModelsDo not have access to expensive analytical softwareMaybe geographically distributedMay need frequent changes or updates to models as business parameters and priorities change\nThis can be achieved by translating the model via an application into an online form, somewhat like in figure 2, where the user inputs the values of the independent variables and the application returns the predicted outcome at the click of a button.\nFigure 2. Online Prediction Form\nOnce we are able to derive this form from the Predictive Model, it in turn could be delivered to geographically dispersed users either via browsers (figure 3) or Smartphones (figure 4)\nFigure 3. Online Prediction on a Browser\n\nFigure 4. Prediction on Smartphone\nOnce this is achieved we have an effective system for deployment that makes it possible for the untrained end-user to harness the power of Predictive Models as easily as a calculator, as shown in figure 5.\nDeployment represents the last stage in the analytics process. With this in place, and the power of Predictive Modeling available to all users in the organization, Predictive Modeling can now be operationalised. It can be used in day to day operational decision making rather than being restricted in its use in an organizational niche for strategic purposes only,\nDeployment with Analuo\nFigure 6 : Deployment with Analuo\nAnaluo is a deployment portal for analytics, intended to enable organizations in operationalising their Predictive Analytics initiative. With its patent pending technology for online prediction, addresses this challenge of deployment. As depicted in figure 6, an analyst uses data in SPSS or R to build a Predictive Model. This Model is now exported out as a PMML file. PMML, standing for Predictive Model Markup Language is an open standard defined by the Data Mining Group (www.dmg.org) for defining and sharing Predictive Models.\nThe Predictive Model, in PMML format, is uploaded to Analuo, which dynamically creates a interface, in the shape of a Prediction Form based on the model, which can is delivered either via a browser or on a Smartphone using Analuos Android app. An end-user, even though not skilled in the techniques of Predictive Modeling, now has to simply enter the values of the independent variables or predictors in the form to obtain a prediction.",

The\nsaid this had been launched at the instigation of Pierre Serne, vice-president of the region le-de-France responsible for transport.\nIt also emerged on Friday that other car manufacturers  BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz  are under scrutiny from the US regulator that exposed Volkswagens manipulation of emissions tests.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has broadened its investigation to include at least 28 diesel-powered car models made by those companies,\n.",

        "blurb": "Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its cars worldwide were designed to cheat emissions testing, in an escalating scandal that has loaded pressure on the wider motor industry.\nCampaigners have long claimed engine emissions figures under laboratory tests are far exceeded in real-life conditions, and experts have said thousands of premature deaths could be averted by ensuring cars meet their legal limits.\nThe German carmakers chief executive apologised but\n, despite its shares slumping and government calls for a European commission inquiry, in what analysts described as a Libor moment for the motor industry.\nVW revealed that it had put aside 6.5bn (4.7bn) to deal with the potential costs of the crisis, although it could still face fines of up to $18bn in a criminal investigation in the US, as well as possible charges for its executives and legal action from customers and shareholders.\nThe US justice department has reportedly already begun an investigation into the alleged cheating. The House oversight and investigations subcommittee announced Monday it planned to hold a hearing in coming weeks and New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has his own investigation underway. No company should be allowed to evade our environmental laws or promise consumers a fake bill of goods, he said in a statement.\nVolkswagen recalled 482,000 VW and Audi brand cars in the US after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found models with Type EA 189 engines had been fitted with a device designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) under testing conditions.\nThe companys chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, defied claims he would be forced out, releasing a video statement saying he was endlessly sorry we betrayed the trust of customers. He pledged: We are going to clarify the background unsparingly, and at this very moment, everything is being put on the table as quickly, thoroughly and transparently as possible.\nHe added: The irregularities with these engines contradict everything for which Volkswagen stands. To make it very clear: manipulation at VW must never happen again.\nAbout 25bn, or a third, has now been wiped off the value of Volkswagens shares in the two days of trading since the scandal erupted. Shares in other car makers have also fallen heavily, with Peugeot down 7%, BMW down 5% and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, also down 5%. German chancellor Angela Merkel demanded complete transparency from Volkswagen to clear up the crisis. Her transport ministry is sending a fact-finding team to examine if the vehicles were built and tested according to German and European rules.\nBritain and France called for a European inquiry into the motor industrys testing. Transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: We are closely monitoring the situation and have been pushing for action at a European level for more accurate tests that reflect driving on the road.\nIts vital that the public has confidence in vehicle emissions tests and I am calling for the European Commission to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.\nAbout one-in-10 new cars sold worldwide is a Volkswagen. With the other brands in its group, including Audi, Seat and Skoda, VW manufactured one-in-five new cars sold in the UK last year. The vehicles identified in the US under the EPA investigation included the Audi A3 and the Golf  two of the top 10 bestselling car models in the UK.\nThe Italian government has launched its own investigation into VWs emissions testing regime, while the French carmakers association backed a call by the finance minister Michel Sapin for a broad inquiry into the industry, saying it would confirm that French manufacturers respect all test proceedings existing in all the countries where they operate.\nHowever, a commission spokesman said it was premature to comment on whether the EC should investigate.\nBritish carmakers said that there was no evidence of manufacturers attempting to cheat the European system, but agreed that the system of testing needed reform. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said:\nThe EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US, with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. Vehicles are removed from the production line randomly and must be standard production models, certified by the relevant authority  the UK body being the Vehicle Certification Agency, which is responsible to the Department for Transport.\nThe industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.\nBut campaigners claim that, even without such brazen defeat devices installed, the testing system is not fit for purpose. A Brussels-based group, Transport & Environment, said millions of cars exceed the legal limits. Jos Dings said: Our latest report demonstrated that almost 90% of diesel vehicles didnt meet emission limits when they drive on the road. We are talking millions of vehicles.\nThe rigging of emissions tests may have added nearly a million tonnes of air pollution by VW cars annually  roughly the same as the UKs combined emissions for all power stations, vehicles, industry and agriculture. According to a Guardian analysis, the 482,000 non-compliant US vehicles would have released between 10,392 and 41,571 tonnes of NOx annually at an average US mileage, rather than the 1,039 tonnes the EPA standards would imply. Scaled to the 11m global vehicles, that would mean up to 948,691 tonnes of NOx emissions annually. Western Europes biggest power station, Drax in the UK, emits 39,000 tonnes of NOx each year.\nThe findings will give fresh urgency to calls to clamp down on diesel vehicles. Despite moves to make diesel engines cleaner, with a new Euro 6 standard implemented for new vehicles claimed to reduce emissions by 90% compared to the oldest cars, the VW scandal will further undermine trust in diesel as air quality worsens. An ultra-low emissions zone planned for London, whose NO2 levels are the highest in the country, will not come into effect until at least 2020.\nProfessor Martin Williams at Kings College London said that emissions from diesel cars cause roughly 5,800 premature deaths in the UK each year. If you were to make the cars emit at the legal limit you could reduce those deaths by at least a factor of two and maybe more. Maybe a factor of five.\nCatherine Bearder MEP, a lead negotiator on the EUs new air quality laws, said: Manufacturers in the US have been caught out, but we know that pollution limits are also being breached in Europe ... Unless we take action, thousands of lives will continue to be tragically cut short by air pollution.\nConsumer groups said that they believed there were issues with testing beyond NOx pollution. BEUC, the European consumer organisation, said: The VW scandal has compounded our concern that underhand tactics are also being used in fuel consumption and CO2 testing programmes in Europe.\nSteve Gooding director of the RAC Foundation, said: Diesel technology has certainly improved over recent years but the question is: by exactly how much? This fiasco shows how urgently an overhaul of testing is needed if trust is to be restored.\nCity firm Bernstein predicted that the scandal could be the beginning of the end for diesel cars in Europe. Analyst Max Warburton said that the VW revelations would hasten the tightening rules on NOx and particulate emissions and make the cars uncompetitive: Regulators will now be much more conservative about what they permit and much tougher real world tests may prove either too difficult  or too expensive  for diesel to meet.\nWhile the effects on British motor manufacturing, which was led by tax incentives to promote diesel as the government tried to meet CO2 emissions targets from Kyoto, would be substantial, campaigners for clean air would welcome the quicker elimination of diesel. Despite the scandal having broken in the US, only around 3% of passenger cars there use diesel, compared with almost half in the EU.",

        "blurb": "As the tiny ball of burning crimson drops behind the sand dunes it leaves a dark, almost silent landscape worthy of its name: Rub' al-Khali, the Empty Quarter.\nNo sooner has the sun gone down than a long necklace of golden lights flickers on in the valley below and the improbable sound of an Islamic preacher can be heard calling the faithful to prayer.\nThis Saudi Arabian desert is one of the most isolated places in the world but it is also home to a huge oil production plant and the 700 staff needed to run it.\nHussain al-Obaid, a slightly greying petroleum engineer, has been watching the same \"son et lumiere\" since 1994 when his employer, the state-owned Saudi Aramco, started to pump oil out of the ground. \"I can think of no better place to work,\" he says and smiles.\nThe Shaybah facility in the south-west corner of the country is not so much oilfield as gold mine. It pumps 500,000 barrels of high quality crude a day, each barrel currently worth not far off $100. That is $50m (24m) every 24 hours, all produced by al-Obaid and his other \"family\" members - as he calls his colleagues. They are already helping to drill more wells so they can crank output up to 750,000 barrels a day by the end of next year.\nIf the planners back at headquarters in Dhahran get their way, Shaybah will eventually be producing 1m barrels a day of this top quality Arab crude.\nThe soaring oil price has meant Saudi export revenues have more than tripled over the past six years. They are expected to reach $165bn this year.\nUpgrading this Empty Quarter facility is one of a number of schemes to raise Saudi output from 11m barrels a day, already 13% of the world's total and 30% of Opec's, to 12.5m by the end of 2009. The eventual target is 15m barrels a day. Foreign firms, including Shell, France's Total and China's Sinopec, have been given unprecedented access to explore for gas in the hope that new supplies will feed industrial production and help conserve the oil. Saudi Aramco has also signed joint ventures with Total and America's ConocoPhilips to establish refineries on the east and west coasts to boost exports of oil products.\nThe exact volume of crude that could be tapped in future is a matter of conjecture. Although the country claims to have 260bn barrels of reserves, many western sceptics feel these numbers are unreliable. They are often the same people who fear the world is past \"peak production\" and on its way to running out.\nWhether it is because the oil is going to run out soon or because it makes sense to diversify an economy that is based almost entirely on one commodity, the Saudi ruling family is spreading its spending around.\nMuch of the country's oil windfall is going abroad, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency investing more than $4bn a month mainly in government bonds issued by the G7 western nations. It owns $265bn of foreign debt.\nState-owned Saudi companies have also been flexing their muscles abroad this year. Saudi Basic Industries bought General Electric's plastics business for $11.6bn, Saad Investment Company took a 3% stake in HSBC bank for $6.6bn and Saudi Telecom bought a 25% stake in Malaysia's mobile phone group Maxis for $3bn.\nEnormous amounts of Saudi money are to be poured into six new \"economic cities\" dotted around the country, which will, crucially, create jobs.\nReliable statistics are hard to come by but external political commentators believe the jobless figure could be as high as 20%, potentially leaving the young Saudi jobless susceptible to extremist Islamist agitators.\nThe largest construction project is King Abdullah Economic City, or KAEC, on the coast between the cities of Mecca and Jeddah, which is designed to cover 168 sq km, create 1m new jobs and become home to 2 million residents.\nThe scheme was envisaged to cost $26bn and take two decades to build.

        "full_text": "As the tiny ball of burning crimson drops behind the sand dunes it leaves a dark, almost silent landscape worthy of its name: Rub' al-Khali, the Empty Quarter.\nNo sooner has the sun gone down than a long necklace of golden lights flickers on in the valley below and the improbable sound of an Islamic preacher can be heard calling the faithful to prayer.\nThis Saudi Arabian desert is one of the most isolated places in the world but it is also home to a huge oil production plant and the 700 staff needed to run it.\nHussain al-Obaid, a slightly greying petroleum engineer, has been watching the same \"son et lumiere\" since 1994 when his employer, the state-owned Saudi Aramco, started to pump oil out of the ground. \"I can think of no better place to work,\" he says and smiles.\nThe Shaybah facility in the south-west corner of the country is not so much oilfield as gold mine. It pumps 500,000 barrels of high quality crude a day, each barrel currently worth not far off $100. That is $50m (24m) every 24 hours, all produced by al-Obaid and his other \"family\" members - as he calls his colleagues. They are already helping to drill more wells so they can crank output up to 750,000 barrels a day by the end of next year.\nIf the planners back at headquarters in Dhahran get their way, Shaybah will eventually be producing 1m barrels a day of this top quality Arab crude.\nThe soaring oil price has meant Saudi export revenues have more than tripled over the past six years. They are expected to reach $165bn this year.\nUpgrading this Empty Quarter facility is one of a number of schemes to raise Saudi output from 11m barrels a day, already 13% of the world's total and 30% of Opec's, to 12.5m by the end of 2009. The eventual target is 15m barrels a day. Foreign firms, including Shell, France's Total and China's Sinopec, have been given unprecedented access to explore for gas in the hope that new supplies will feed industrial production and help conserve the oil. Saudi Aramco has also signed joint ventures with Total and America's ConocoPhilips to establish refineries on the east and west coasts to boost exports of oil products.\nThe exact volume of crude that could be tapped in future is a matter of conjecture. Although the country claims to have 260bn barrels of reserves, many western sceptics feel these numbers are unreliable. They are often the same people who fear the world is past \"peak production\" and on its way to running out.\nWhether it is because the oil is going to run out soon or because it makes sense to diversify an economy that is based almost entirely on one commodity, the Saudi ruling family is spreading its spending around.\nMuch of the country's oil windfall is going abroad, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency investing more than $4bn a month mainly in government bonds issued by the G7 western nations. It owns $265bn of foreign debt.\nState-owned Saudi companies have also been flexing their muscles abroad this year. Saudi Basic Industries bought General Electric's plastics business for $11.6bn, Saad Investment Company took a 3% stake in HSBC bank for $6.6bn and Saudi Telecom bought a 25% stake in Malaysia's mobile phone group Maxis for $3bn.\nEnormous amounts of Saudi money are to be poured into six new \"economic cities\" dotted around the country, which will, crucially, create jobs.\nReliable statistics are hard to come by but external political commentators believe the jobless figure could be as high as 20%, potentially leaving the young Saudi jobless susceptible to extremist Islamist agitators.\nThe largest construction project is King Abdullah Economic City, or KAEC, on the coast between the cities of Mecca and Jeddah, which is designed to cover 168 sq km, create 1m new jobs and become home to 2 million residents.\nThe scheme was envisaged to cost $26bn and take two decades to build. The government has decided to fast-track the project for 2016 and the latest projections for all six city schemes suggest the cost could reach $111bn, driven up by competition for raw materials from construction hotspots such as Dubai and China.\nThe port alone at KAEC will cover 14 sq km and will be the fifth biggest container port in the world.\nThe second of the six schemes is to be Knowledge Economic City in the Madinah area at a cost of $6.7bn and with a target to create 20,000 jobs.

Ports, including refuelling hub Fujairah in the UAE, have been closed to Qatari-flagged ships raising concerns over cost hikes and delays to shipments.\nA few decades ago, this would not have mattered to the UK. Britain was self-sufficient in gas from the North Sea until 2004 but declining domestic production means that 60% of gas is now imported. National Grid, which operates Britains energy networks, believes the reliance on imports could reach 93% by 2040. This means the\ndispute inevitably raises concerns.\nHowever, Dr Bassam Fattouh, the director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the situation would have little effect on gas exports. I dont see any impact on energy supplies to the UK and to the rest of the world, he said. Why would Qatar stop exporting LNG? The shipping lanes are open.\nThe markets should not be spooked, he added, although he warned the crisis could introduce some erratic volatility to oil and gas markets.\nAnalysts at Julius Baer, the Swiss bank, echoed that view. Disruptions, especially of the seaborne shipments, are highly unlikely, they said.\nIra Joseph, head of gas analytics at consultancy Pira Energy, said: The UK market is the destination of last resort for Qatari LNG, so it would be the last and not the first place to have an impact.\nNorway provides nearly two-thirds of UK gas imports via pipelines, while\n. Italy is the second biggest European importer of Qatari gas, according to analysts at oil and gas group Wood Mackenzie. Poland opened its first LNG terminal last year, to import from Qatar and the US in a bid to reduce its reliance on Russian gas.\nIn Britain, the heavily compressed gas is taken by vast Qatari tankers to one of three LNG terminals, where it is stored, ready to be returned to its gaseous state to heat homes and fuel power stations. One terminal is run by British\nowner Centrica in the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary. Two are in south Wales  one owned by Shell and the other by Qatar, which also owns other significant UK assets such as the Shard and Harrods.\nProponents of fracking to extract shale gas said the problems facing Doha showed why the UK must develop its own shale gas industry, like the US.\nWhats happening [in Qatar] is quite unprecedented, said Ken Cronin, chief executive of the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group (Ukoog). While escalation in the Gulf and disruption of energy supplies seemed unlikely now, he said, it would have a broader impact on the world if the situation worsened.\nIts important for us to insulate, he said . Maybe not so much for now, because we have the North Sea and Norway, but by 2030-35 we are going to be importing 70%-80% of our gas, and the majority of that is going to come from the LNG market if we havent started the shale gas industry.\nExploratory shale gas drilling has been bogged down in the planning process\n, but the Conservative manifesto pledged to remove the need for planning permission for small sites. Fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped gas to the surface - a technique opposed by environmentalists and local communities.\nThe first major exploratory drilling is expected to begin in the next two months at\n, a leading British fracking company.\nCronin admitted that even if a commercial shale gas industry was up and running by the end of the decade, as he hoped, it was too early to say if it could compete on price with LNG imports. Thats difficult to answer now, he said.\nOther customers of Qatars gas include the UAE and\n, two of the countries that cut diplomatic ties with Doha. Despite the row, Qatar is still supplying the UAE via a pipeline that provides crucial gas for the power stations that the capital Abu Dhabi relies on. The Dolphin pipeline supplies 35% of the UAEs gas demand.\nSo far there is no indication that either the Qataris or the Emiratis are going to disrupt the gas flows from the pipeline, said Fattouh.\nHowever, he said that if there was disruption of the pipeline, it would be quite problematic, especially during summer, when air conditioning and other factors meant electricity demand was high.\nThere is no sign either that Egypt is turning away Qatari LNG shipments. Cairo is bound by international agreements to keep the Suez canal open to Qatari tankers, though it could reduce the discount such LNG ships enjoy. Even if the Suez passage was blocked or rendered uneconomical, experts said, it would not add a huge amount of time if vessels had to go around the Horn of Africa.\nWhile Qatars riches are built on gas, which it only began exporting in 1996, the country is also a member of Opec, the cartel of major oil-producers.\nDoha is seen as unlikely to want to scupper\nto buoy up the oil price. Even if it did, or was ejected from the group as part of the diplomatic row, the ripples are likely to be minimal, as Qatar only accounts for 2% of Opecs oil output.\nIn terms of Opec, Qatar is a very small player, said Fattouh. Opec has had worse conflicts in past.\nThe UK, nonetheless, will hope for a swift conclusion to the Qatar spat.",
        "full_text": "Britains increasing reliance on energy imports as the North Seas oil and gas wealth declines has been highlighted by the\n.\nNearly a third of the UKs gas imports are from the tiny Gulf state, the worlds largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which it ships to Europe and Asia, including to its three biggest customers: JapanIndia and South Korea.\nQatars transport links\non Monday over Dohas alleged funding of extremist groups. Ports, including refuelling hub Fujairah in the UAE, have been closed to Qatari-flagged ships raising concerns over cost hikes and delays to shipments.\nA few decades ago, this would not have mattered to the UK. Britain was self-sufficient in gas from the North Sea until 2004 but declining domestic production means that 60% of gas is now imported. National Grid, which operates Britains energy networks, believes the reliance on imports could reach 93% by 2040. This means the\ndispute inevitably raises concerns.\nHowever, Dr Bassam Fattouh, the director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the situation would have little effect on gas exports. I dont see any impact on energy supplies to the UK and to the rest of the world, he said. Why would Qatar stop exporting LNG? The shipping lanes are open.\nThe markets should not be spooked, he added, although he warned the crisis could introduce some erratic volatility to oil and gas markets.\nAnalysts at Julius Baer, the Swiss bank, echoed that view. Disruptions, especially of the seaborne shipments, are highly unlikely, they said.\nIra Joseph, head of gas analytics at consultancy Pira Energy, said: The UK market is the destination of last resort for Qatari LNG, so it would be the last and not the first place to have an impact.\nNorway provides nearly two-thirds of UK gas imports via pipelines, while\n.

Conspiracy theories about it snooping on people through its microphone, and confusion about it collecting SMS and call log history likely pushed Facebook to give people details about what data its slurping up.\nFacebook now explains that (emphasis mine):\nInformation we obtain from these devices includes:\n Device attributes: information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions,\n, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.\n Device operations: information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as\n, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).\n Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to associated with the same device or account).\n Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about\n.\n Data from device settings: information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.\n Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases,\n, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.\n Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.\nSpecifically regarding SMS history and call logs, Facebook writes, We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know. Though Facebook asked users permission for this data, nothing about SMS and call logs wasnt in the terms of service.\nDisappointingly, the new explanation of helping you find friends doesnt necessarily justify it collecting this data. Meanwhile, just today Facebook confirmed to\nthat it does automatically scan all the text and image content of Messenger conversations to prevent violations of its Community Standards and the spread of spam or abuse. While other tech products like Googles Gmail scan the contents of your messages for advertising and other purposes, the revelation could scare some privacy-focused users away from Messenger.\nFacebook has also clarified how new products its launched since the last TOS update  like Marketplace, fundraisers, Live, 360 and camera effects  work. It explains how every users experience is personalized. A new Music Use Policy has been added as Facebook strikes deals with the major record labels.\nFinally, Facebook makes it clear that it, WhatsApp and Oculus (as well as Instagram) are all part of one company that it refers to as The Facebook Companies, though WhatsApp and Oculus have their own data polices. Instagram is now repeatedly mentioned in the TOS and DUP, whereas before it wasnt even mentioned. The recent #DeleteFacebook movement that missed Instagram indicated that many users dont quite realize theyre part of the same corporation.\nAs Facebook deals with a disgruntled public and awoken regulatory bodies, the rewriting of these policies might be perceived as the company trying to cover itself after neglecting to detail how it pulls and uses peoples data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg might face questions about the changes and why they werent in place before\nregarding protections of users data privacy.\nBut todays revamp could also give Facebook stronger documents to point to as it tries to prove it doesnt need heavy-handed government regulation.

Conspiracy theories about it snooping on people through its microphone, and confusion about it collecting SMS and call log history likely pushed Facebook to give people details about what data its slurping up.\nFacebook now explains that (emphasis mine):\nInformation we obtain from these devices includes:\n Device attributes: information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions,\n, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.\n Device operations: information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as\n, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).\n Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to associated with the same device or account).\n Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about\n.\n Data from device settings: information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.\n Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases,\n, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.\n Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.\nSpecifically regarding SMS history and call logs, Facebook writes, We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know. Though Facebook asked users permission for this data, nothing about SMS and call logs wasnt in the terms of service.\nDisappointingly, the new explanation of helping you find friends doesnt necessarily justify it collecting this data. Meanwhile, just today Facebook confirmed to\nthat it does automatically scan all the text and image content of Messenger conversations to prevent violations of its Community Standards and the spread of spam or abuse. While other tech products like Googles Gmail scan the contents of your messages for advertising and other purposes, the revelation could scare some privacy-focused users away from Messenger.\nFacebook has also clarified how new products its launched since the last TOS update  like Marketplace, fundraisers, Live, 360 and camera effects  work. It explains how every users experience is personalized. A new Music Use Policy has been added as Facebook strikes deals with the major record labels.\nFinally, Facebook makes it clear that it, WhatsApp and Oculus (as well as Instagram) are all part of one company that it refers to as The Facebook Companies, though WhatsApp and Oculus have their own data polices. Instagram is now repeatedly mentioned in the TOS and DUP, whereas before it wasnt even mentioned. The recent #DeleteFacebook movement that missed Instagram indicated that many users dont quite realize theyre part of the same corporation.\nAs Facebook deals with a disgruntled public and awoken regulatory bodies, the rewriting of these policies might be perceived as the company trying to cover itself after neglecting to detail how it pulls and uses peoples data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg might face questions about the changes and why they werent in place before\nregarding protections of users data privacy.\nBut todays revamp could also give Facebook stronger documents to point to as it tries to prove it doesnt need heavy-handed government regulation. Switching from a more legalese document full of jargon to a more laymans version could also help it dispel myths or give people more transparency.\nIf Facebook can give users a better understanding of how it works, it might be able to diffuse privacy scandals and backlashes before they happen.\nby\non Scribd\nby\non Scribd",
